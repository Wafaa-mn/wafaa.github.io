CSS can select HTML elements by their type, class, and ID. CSS classes and
 IDs have different purposes,
 Specificity is the order by which the browser decides which CSS styles will be displayed.
  A best practice in CSS is to style elements while using the lowest degree of specificity
  so that if an element needs a new style, it is easy to override.

IDs are the most specific selector in CSS, followed by classes, and finally, type.
For example, consider the following HTML and CSS:

Chaning is good
<a href="#introduction">Introduction</a> this is when you click it takes you to the exact place where the info is at in the page
<div id="introduction"><!--#example of how to link within the same page. --> </div>

body {
  /* Old browsers */
  background: #FFC0CB; /* Fallback solid pink */
  /* Chrome 10-25, Safari 5.1-6 */
  background: -webkit-linear-gradient(-45deg, #FF69B4, #FFC0CB); /* Pink gradient */
  /* W3C, IE 10+/ Edge, Firefox 16+, Chrome 26+, Opera 12+, Safari 7+ */
  background: linear-gradient(-45deg, #FF69B4, #FFC0CB); /* Pink gradient */
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
}

        <p class="text-container">I have been gaining valuable experience in customer service roles
            since 2018. Now, I am seeking professional training related to my major to learn and apply
            new skills and secure a full-time position. In the meantime, I'm focusing on gaining new
            skills and enjoying the thrill of working with what I learn. This portfolio, as simple as it is,
            has been an incredible experience to create. Seeing something I envisioned appear on screen is
            satisfying, and it has helped me explore and learn new things about HTML and CSS along the way.
            <br>As my main career focus is on Data, I am learning more about data analysis, modeling,
            and visualization,  including tools like Power BI. Soon, I will be adding the projects I
            am working on here.
